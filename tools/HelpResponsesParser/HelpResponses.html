<p><b>What TWL </b> <br/>
<em>TWL stands for Trench Wars Leagues. It has three divisions: Javelin (TWLJ), Dueling (TWLD), and Basing (TWLB). Javelin and Dueling play matches with 5 players per team, while basing features 8 players per team. Months before the league starts, squads compete in duels for ranking. In order to qualify for TWL, a squad must play 15 games in one division. The exact number of squads that are invited to participate depends on the amount of competition and demand in a specific division. If a squad drops out of the league, then the next highest ranking squad is invited to play. The TWL season is a very competitive time for most squads. It brings the most skilled players to the same arena in order to battle it out for victory and gain the esteem from all players as "the best." It is the highlight of Trench Wars and its reputation and prestige can not be compared to any other zone in Continuum.     </em></p>

<em>A continuum is something that keeps on going, changing slowly over time, like the continuum of the four seasons.

For example, in the game, at any time, there are newplayers who are learning warbird, then advancing to javelin, spider, and terrier. Just as the newplayers master their particular ship, they move on to the next one, as other newplayers enter the game and the vets retire.</em></p>

<p><b>Time Drowned River </b> <br/>
<em>So I was around 12 years old when I almost died the first time. I was floating on an innertube down the river, pretty wide, deep river, flooded every year and it always brought a lot of trees down with it when it did. This means there were a lot of logjams, of course. Now a logjam is a nasty piece of business for a child; you get under there and you're bound to be caught between two logs, easy, drown forever. Gone. Never heard from again. Well, I wasn't too experienced on the water yet, but what do you know? I got ahead of my mom a bit, just floating down the river, a swift river ... and suddenly the current starts to steer me into one of the logjams at a sharp bend. I start backpeddling, but there's nothing doing ... I'm pushed right toward it. Before I know it I'm up against a log, just hanging on for dear sweet life. I thought I could wait for my mom, right? She'd rescue me? Ah, good parenting. Nothing. I waited, and I waited, holding on, my grip slipping. I yelled. I was too scared to cry. And as I felt my grip weakening, I knew I had to just do it or get sucked down .... so all at once I gathered the last bit of my strength, and, giving up my only grip, the only thing keeping me from getting taken under, I pushed off HARD with my legs. It was just enough -- just enough to clear that logjam. And the river took me down into the peaceful warm currents on a sunny day. I didn't say a word about it to anyone.</em></p>
