To use the update.exe file, create a folder in your server folder called:
version1

Then in this folder, extract the update.exe file to here. Also, copy continuum.exe from your
server folder into this folder. Once there, rename continuum.exe to subspace.exe. Now startup
your zone, and you now have continuum .36 allowed into your zone.

NOTE: If people download the upgrade.exe from your zone, they maybe lagged out during
download. To prevent this, in your server.ini, set the [Misc] MenuKickoutDelay to 60000.
